# osintify
Collection of scripts and tips to setup an OSINT machine.

## osintify.sh
A bash script that installs various packages that I use on pretty much every investigation. Written to be easily extensible. Relies on the "apt" package manager and I've only tested on base Debian and Ubuntu installs.

## osint_bookmarks.html
OSINT-related bookmarks to add to your browser's bookmarks bar. Includes a collection of bespoke bookmarklets for various tasks. The names of the bookmarklets hopefully give a good idea what they do. Keep in mind that they all run in the context of the current page so will use whatever domain or page you are on for the various things it does.
